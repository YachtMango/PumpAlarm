# PumpAlarm
Bore Hole Pump Timer
A series of interations of code ( in seperate files) that allow a 12v pump to run for a time period.  
The code runs on a Pi Zero W and Pimoroni Automation Hat mini.

This is an addon to an existing solar powered battery and controller that powers the pump and Pi.  
The problem to solve was that I kept leaving the pump running beyond the recomende duty cucle of the pump and the bore hole would run dry
